1. convert digital watch to binary watch

2. find first duplicate character in the string

3. Find whether 2 strings are anagrams :
Fried --- fired
Gainly – laying
Sadder – dreads

4. Suppose there are 2 strings source =”abcde” target =”ab” . Your program should return true if target is there in source. And also if the reverse of target is there in source

5. An array has numbers from 1 to 20 . some of the numbers are missing if we sort the numbers in asending order. Find out the missing numbers.

6. Find the first non repeating character in a string eg: helloworld h is the answer.

7. Find the palindromic permutations for Malayalam.  (Prefer problem p9.py)

8. Give an array of anagrams [“Fried”, “Gainly” ,”fired”, “dreads” ,”laying”, “Sadder” ,”god”, “goat”]
Group them as follows:  [Pending]
[
[“Fried”, ”fired”],
[“Gainly”, ”laying”],
[“dreads”, “Sadder”],
[“god”],
[“goat”]
]

9. Find out all palindromic substrings from a give string eg: aabbaacabcadadad  (Pending)


10. Problem Statement:
Line1 is a dictionary of words. Convert Line 2 to a meaningful sentence by referring to the words in Line1.  (Pending)
Example1:
// String line1 = "I,A,AM,HE,HERE";
// String line2 = "IAMHERE";
Solution :I AM HERE                     
Example2:
